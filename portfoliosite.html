<h1>Brooke Hand's Portfolio Project</h1>

<h2>Biography</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">I am a student in the MIT xPro Professional Certificate in Coding Program. This website outlines the portfolio I have put together during my time in this program thus far to showcase what I have learned. The three exercises that I have included in my portfolio are the Eye Exercise, the PacMen Exercise, and the Real-Time Bus Tracker App.

<h3>PacMen Exercise</h3>
<p>In this exercise, I created an on-demand (via click of the mouse) PacMen feature. When a user clicks "Add PacMen," a PacMen will appear on the screen. Then when the user clicks "Start Game," the PacMen will start moving around the screen at random velocity. You can find my repository for this exercise on GitHub here: <a href="https://github.com/brookehand/pacmen">PacMen Repository</a>

<h3>Eye Exercise</h3>
<p>In this exercise I used the mouse movement event to move shapes on the screen that resemble eyes. By doing so, the eyes will appear to be following the mouse pointer. You can view this repository here: <a href="https://github.com/brookehand/eyeExercise">Eye Movement Repository</a></p>
<h3>Bus Tracker</h3>
<p>In this exercise, you will see real-time bus locations between MIT and Harvard using Google Maps. The application uses Google Maps and pulls location information every 15 seconds to update the location of each bus.
